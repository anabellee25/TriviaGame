# TriviaGame

I created this game as a homework assignment showing my progress with understanding
jQuery and javaScript.

Though challenging, I beleive that I've gained a deeper understanding of how 
functions operate and how detail oriented you have to be in order for your code 
not to break.

In this game, I chose "The Office" as my theme. It is one of my favorite TV Shows
and there are a lot of great one liners that I just couldn't NOT pick it as 
my theme. 

HAVE FUN AND ENJOY!
